# gpt-data-extracting
 
The application is designed to process raw job postings and extract the specific skills and abilities required for the job.

The application had to process about 5 million rows of raw data to produce a set of pure requirements. In theory, this dataset should be used to train a neural network that would be able to identify requirements in the job text without the need to use third-party expensive llm's. 

The data is also supposed to be used to identify trends in the skills and knowledge required from job seekers in different business fields, which should be useful for both job seekers and employers.
